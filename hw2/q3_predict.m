function pred_y = q3_predict(Xtrain, Ytrain, xtest, k)
% Uses kNN to predict the label of the input example given the training set
% (Xtrain, Ytrain) and the neighborhood size k.

% INPUT
%  Xtrain      : [m x n] matrix, where each row is an n-dimensional input *training* example
%  Ytrain      : [m x 1] vector, where the i-th element is the label for the i-th *training* example
%  xtest       : [1 x n] vector, the input feature vector of test example
%  k           : [1 x 1] scalar, the neighborhood size used by kNN

% OUTPUT
%  pred_y: [1 x 1] scalar, the predicted label for xtest

% HINT
%  It is possible to implement this function without using for or while
%  loops. This can be achieved via vectorization. This will make your code much faster.

[m, n] = size(Xtrain);
distance = (Xtrain - repmat(xtest, [m, 1]) .^ 2);
distance = sum(distance, 2); 

[distanceSorted indexes] = sort(distance);
