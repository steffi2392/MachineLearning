function feat_selected = q4_split(X, Y, feat_idx)
% Find the split that maximizes the information gain for the subset 
% (X, Y) of the training set

% INPUT
%  X      : [m x n] matrix, where each row is an n-dimensional input example
%  Y      : [m x 1] vector, where the i-th element is the label for the i-th example
%  feat_idx : [1 x L] vector, indices of features to be considered

% OUTPUT
%  feat_selected : [1 x 1] scalar, the feature that maximizes the information gain for (X, Y) 
%                  (this should be one of the numbers stored in feat_idx and an integer between 1 and n)
